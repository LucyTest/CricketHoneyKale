We are Lisa Hachmann, Logan Sweet, and Lucy Wilcox with CricketHoneyKale and we have made a random recipe generator using Python 2.7. 

This is a project intended to create unique recipes using data from pre-exisitng online recipes.

To run our program, head on over to our Github repo: https://github.com/LucyWilcox/CricketHoneyKale and clone it.

Then run the file: runCricketHoneyKale.py

You'll need to have the Tkinter ($ sudo apt-get install python-tk) downloaded to run our program from the GUI.

If you want to run all file (recreating existing pickled files) you'll need more libraries. You will also need to go into database_of_recipies.py and un-comment the imports. These libraries include:
NLTK ($ sudo pip install -U nltk)
pattern.web ($ sudo pip install pattern)
requests ($ sudo pip install requests)
Beautiful Soup/bs4 (sudo pip install beautifulsoup4) OR (apt-get install python-bs4)

All directions assume you have python 2.7 installed.
