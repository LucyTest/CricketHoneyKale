All directions for running main.py are for Debian or Ubuntu Linux

To install Beautiful Soup, write in terminal: #probably not needed
apt-get install python-bs4

To install pattern.web, write in terminal: #probably not needed
pip install pattern

All of these libraries are necessary to run main.py, which is called from the GUI

NLTK  is not nessisary to install, as the files created with it are pickled.

To run the GUI, and use our lovely program, open terminal, cd into the correct directory and write:
python GUIlogan2.py
