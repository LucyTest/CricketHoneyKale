Code Review Feedback: Cricket Honey Kale


# of Recipes:
Revert to recipe with less ingredients if there's not enough recipes to reference


Instruction:
Start with bullets
Type of soups: Creamy, Vegetable, etc to get a structured instructions
Kinda like MadLibs


Bizarreness:
Degrees of separation/risk
If (ex) you pick 7/10 (more bizarre) then it’ll pick an ingredient that is in 1 out of the 7 soups, statisticallys
Note: Add dressing and toppings equivalent to smoothie
Flavor profile
Proportions → steps on the bizarreness
Make a bunch and list them from coherent → bizarre
Swap 2 ingredients for slightly bizarre
Danger Factor depends on type of food
