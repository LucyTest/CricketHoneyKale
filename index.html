<p>The Big Idea</p>

<p>We are creating a software which will generate recipes for most daily food types, with a focus on cooking not baking. We are exploring data management, computer generated information, and GUIs. Our minimum viable product is generating a passable salad recipe. Additional goals are creating really tasty recipes, beautiful UI/UX, giving the program increasing levels of freedom and having it still render good food, and the user might also be able to give feedback and possibly even learn from said feedback.</p>

<p>Learning Goals</p>

<p>All three of us are interested in learning how to make and use GUIs. Lucy is interested in deciding how the computer will generate and decide the recipes, Lisa is interested in how it will use and manipulate the information from the database, and Logan wants to focus the most on creating the GUI. We want to get more familiar with classes, plan our code structure before we begin implementing, become more comfortable using Git, and have clean, reliable, readable, commented code.</p>

<p>Implementation Plan</p>

<p>We will start with recipe data manipulation in order to move into recipe generation. We will chose a GUI library with the insight of others (professors, NINJAs). We will address our recipe as a dictionary or list of ingredients, and also perhaps with some sort of taste profile. Overall, the program would look at other recipes and see what foods appear together and then look at this online data to chose food combinations. </p>

<p>Project schedule</p>

<p>Deadlines:</p>

<p>March 30: Create basic implementation plan for software, Have recipe database for testing</p>

<p>April 2: Design Review!</p>

<pre><code>Deliverable: If you have one ingredient, give 1-5 ingredients that go with it. Have final design plan for software execution. 
</code></pre>

<p>April 6: Use generated list of recipes to make instructions</p>

<p>April 13: Code Review!</p>

<p>April 20: Continue to refine instructions</p>

<p>April 23: Mid-Project presentation, Think about GUI</p>

<p>April 27: Determine if a recipe is “good” or not</p>

<p>May 4: Finish project; practice final presentation</p>

<p>May 6: Final due date and project presentation</p>

<p>Collaboration plan</p>

<p>We plan to have multiple pair programming techniques: rotating pair programming and experiment with triple programming (having a driver, navigator, and googler). We plan on having quick reflections with every deadline but also decide before every meeting what we will try to get done, and after every meeting decide what we should individually do before the next meeting. Logan and Lisa both prefer working in pairs, while Lucy is flexible and neutral, so the decisions on the pairing of work will happen based more on scheduling. We will also have multiple files (one for the GUI and one or more for dealing with our data) so people can focus on different parts and work at the same time. Floobits might also be used so we can work together on the code.</p>

<p>Risks</p>

<p>We are at risk for making nasty recipes and having inaccurate instructions. The instructions will be a particularly large risk just because every recipe cooks differently and it’s hard to base the instructions of a new recipe off an old one. To avoid this, we will start with salads and smoothies, examples of foods with a standard instruction pattern. Getting a functional GUI will be more difficult than running our software through the terminal, but will make a huge difference in terms of professionalism and functionality. </p>

<p>Additional Course Content</p>

<p>Support on other GUI platforms besides PyGame would be useful to learn about in class. The rest of the project seems manageable with the course content we have already learned, although more understanding of classes and objects will of course help us. We  don’t really know what machine learning is, but it might be useful. </p>

Design Review</p>

<p>Background and context: </p>

<p>We are making a program that generates recipes by using web mined data from recipes online. Our recipe will both have ingredients and instructions. We are focusing on cooking, not baking (no yeast, baking powder, or baking soda). We may only complete a simpler version of this which creates salad or smoothie recipes. Our audience should know something about food (which we really hope/assume they do) and that’s about it!</p>

<p>Key questions:</p>

<p>Our questions are as follows: </p>

<p>How should the recipe URLs and recipes be stored? </p>

<p>What GUI is simple to implement and can fit our needs?</p>

<p>What logic should we use to use to generate recipes? </p>

<pre><code>looking at what ingredients are often used together?

create flavor profiles and pull from those lists?

other? 
</code></pre>

<p>Do you know of any libraries that would be useful to us?</p>

<p>We are most interested in hearing others’ ideas on how we could generate recipes. Since part of our goal in creating recipes is to create good recipes, we know that our ingredient selection algorithm will be essential. While we have a couple ideas as to how the logic of this part of our software will work, we would like some feedback as to whether or not people think our plan will be successful as well as hearing any other ideas for the logic of recipe selection.  </p>

<p>Agenda for technical review session:</p>

<p>We are planning to use the collaborative ideation structure for our design review. We will pass out post it notes in the beginning of class and present questions while we explain the steps of our project and the questions we have about each step. At the end of the presentation we will have an ideation period for all of the questions said during the presentation. At the end of the ideation period, we will have the audience put the questions on the whiteboards and ask all of the solutions to be put under the allotted whiteboard space for that question. A discussion can be started if necessary to explain certain solutions where everyone can weigh in with pros and cons regarding each.</p>

<p>Software Design Review 1- Reflections</p>

<p>by Cricket Honey Kale</p>

<p>Feedback and Decisions</p>

<p>We were told that we'd be able to make more recipes than we had originally planned by starting with classes that have one repeatable/slightly adjustable instruction set. As well, we were told about qtpython, flask and django as gui options. As for the recipe generation methodology, the consensus of the group validated our idea of how to sort and combine ingredients. There were additional edge cases that were pointed out, like not to randomly select more than one heating process (cooking, frying, boiling) and, for example, not frying, baking and then boiling a chicken. In order to implement it, we will put in code to protect from the edge cases, look at the guis presented and try one library each to select the best one, and each choose one class of food category to create, after the general shifting of our current classes. The new questions that came up for us is how exactly we’d like the user interface to look and how many categories of food we will have to time to incorporate. </p>

<p>Review Process Reflection: </p>

<p>Since we forced ideation by getting people up to whiteboards, it seemed that we received a greater quantity of feedback than other groups in our section. Since people were interacting with each other while ideating, they were able to generate ideas in a more team oriented way. The main question, that of which GUI we should use, was not fully nailed down, but we received good advice which we will continue to take under consideration. We think that by offering little more than questions for people when we asked for feedback that we allowed for a greater amount of freedom in people’s thoughts, which hopefully let to more creativity. We could have made this process better by not mentioning some of the answers we were considering to not constrain people to one line of thinking, especially in terms of our thought process for ingredient list creation. Our planned agenda was very loose and allowed for a lot of discussion between participants in the design review as well as between us and the reviewers. This setup worked well for us, and we will consider repeating this strategy in future design reviews. </p>
