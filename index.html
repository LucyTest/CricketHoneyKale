        <p>Final Project Proposal: Lisa Hachmann, Logan Sweet, Lucy Wilcox (Section 2)</p>

<p>The Big Idea:</p>

<p>We are creating a software which the user can enter their nutritional goals and receive a computer generated daily meal plan. We are exploring data management, computer generated information, and GUIs. Our minimum viable product is an interface which you enter in nutritional data and it will give you a recipe. Additional goals are creating really tasty recipes, beautiful UI/UX, giving the program increasing levels of freedom and having it still render good food, and the user might also be able to give feedback and possibly even learn from said feedback.</p>

<p>Learning Goals:</p>

<p>All three of us are interested in learning how to make and use GUIs. Lucy is interested in deciding how the computer will generate and decide the recipes, Lisa is interested in how it will use and manipulate the information from the database, and Logan wants to focus the most on creating the GUI. We want to get more familiar with classes, plan our code structure before we begin implementing, become more comfortable using Git, and have clean, reliable, readable, commented code.</p>

<p>Implementation Plan:</p>

<p>We will simultaneously work on GUI and nutritional data manipulation. We will chose a GUI library with the insight of others (professors, NINJAs). Learning about how people address their diets in the real world may be helpful to creating reasonable dietary plans. We will address our food as a list of nutrients, and also with some sort of taste profile. Another possibly is the program would look at other recipes and see what foods appear together and then look at this online data to chose food combinations. </p>

<p>Cricket Honey Kale Schedule:</p>

<p>March 30:   Create basic implementation plan for software
            Have recipe database for testing
April 2:    Design Review! 
                Deliverable: if you have one ingredient, give 1-5 ingredients that go with it
            Have final design plan for software execution
April 6:    Use generated list of recipes to make instructions
April 13:   Code Review!
April 20:   Continue to refine instructions 
April 23:   Mid-Project presentation
            Think about GUI
April 27:   Determine if a recipe is "good" or not
May 4:      Finish project; practice final presentation 
May 6:      Final due date and project presentation</p>

<p>Collaboration plan:</p>

<p>We plan to have multiple pair programming techniques: rotating pair programming and experiment with triple programming (having a driver, navigator, and googler). We plan on having quick reflections with every deadline but also decide before every meeting what we will try to get done, and after every meeting decide what we should individually do before the next meeting. Logan and Lisa both prefer working in pairs, while Lucy is flexible and neutral, so the decisions on the pairing of work will happen based more on scheduling. We will also have multiple files (one for the GUI and one or more for dealing with our data) so people can focus on different parts and work at the same time. Floobits might also be used so we can work together on the code.</p>

<p>Risks:</p>

<p>If we use incorrect or inconsistent nutritional data for our software the results provided will not be accurate. Additionally, if retrieving nutritional information proves to be difficult, implementing a useful tool will be near impossible. Getting a functional GUI will be more difficult than running our software through the terminal, but will make a huge difference in terms of professionalism and functionality. </p>

<p>Additional Course Content:</p>

<p>Support on other GUI platforms besides PyGame would be useful to learn about in class. The rest of the project seems manageable with the course content we have already learned, although more understanding of classes and objects will of course help us. We are not sure if it is machine learning, but addressing user feedback (liking or disliking) on recipes and improving suggestions based on that is a stretch goal for us and something we might like to learn more about.</p>
