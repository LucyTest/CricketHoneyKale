qtpython - gui library
store recipes in a text file 
explicitly with certain form
text (ingredient) clustering to generate random recipe
Rating - if you rate a recipe, it's more likely to show up the next time

Ex
Chicken: 400 degrees for 30 min - only choose degrees 1 time per ingredient?
dict --> {meat: [chicken, beef...]} so you can search if the recipe has meat and skip it if vegetarian option is chosen
Category: heat- oven, grill
^Only choose one in that category
Flask, Django: more gui libraries
Ex. zuchini- boil, -cook (options of recipes using zuchini)
Squash : 5 matches w zuchini but uses fry (no match)
Carrots: 4 matches, uses cook
^Picks carrots!


Ben's things:
Static database
pickle, text
Database class

Synthesization:
We were told that we'd be able to make more recipes than we had originally planned by starting with classes that have one repeatable instruction set.
