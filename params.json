{"name":"Cricket  Honey Kale","tagline":"Nutritional Recipe Generator Final Project","body":"Final Project Proposal: Lisa Hachmann, Logan Sweet, Lucy Wilcox (Section 2)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Big Idea:\r\n\r\nWe are creating a software which the user can enter their nutritional goals and receive a computer generated daily meal plan. We are exploring data management, computer generated information, and GUIs. Our minimum viable product is an interface which you enter in nutritional data and it will give you a recipe. Additional goals are creating really tasty recipes, beautiful UI/UX, giving the program increasing levels of freedom and having it still render good food, and the user might also be able to give feedback and possibly even learn from said feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning Goals:\r\n\r\nAll three of us are interested in learning how to make and use GUIs. Lucy is interested in deciding how the computer will generate and decide the recipes, Lisa is interested in how it will use and manipulate the information from the database, and Logan wants to focus the most on creating the GUI. We want to get more familiar with classes, plan our code structure before we begin implementing, become more comfortable using Git, and have clean, reliable, readable, commented code.\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementation Plan:\r\n\r\nWe will simultaneously work on GUI and nutritional data manipulation. We will chose a GUI library with the insight of others (professors, NINJAs). Learning about how people address their diets in the real world may be helpful to creating reasonable dietary plans. We will address our food as a list of nutrients, and also with some sort of taste profile. Another possibly is the program would look at other recipes and see what foods appear together and then look at this online data to chose food combinations. \r\n\r\n\r\nProject schedule:\r\n\r\nDeadlines:\r\n\r\nMarch 30: Get nutritional data from online source reliably in a useful format, choose GUI library, interfacing login \r\n\r\nApril 2: Design Review, begin GUI\r\n\r\nApril 6: Finish nutritional information calculator\r\n\r\nApril 13:Code Review, Finish nutrition-based meal generation\r\n\r\nApril 20: Finish recipe generation tool\r\n\r\nApril 23: Mid-Project presentation \r\n\r\nApril 27: Create Project Website\r\n\r\nMay 4: Finish project and begin practicing presentation for final due date\r\n\r\nMay 6: Final due date and presentation\r\n\r\n\r\nCollaboration plan:\r\n\r\nWe plan to have multiple pair programming techniques: rotating pair programming and experiment with triple programming (having a driver, navigator, and googler). We plan on having quick reflections with every deadline but also decide before every meeting what we will try to get done, and after every meeting decide what we should individually do before the next meeting. Logan and Lisa both prefer working in pairs, while Lucy is flexible and neutral, so the decisions on the pairing of work will happen based more on scheduling. We will also have multiple files (one for the GUI and one or more for dealing with our data) so people can focus on different parts and work at the same time. Floobits might also be used so we can work together on the code.\r\n \r\n\r\nRisks:\r\n\r\nIf we use incorrect or inconsistent nutritional data for our software the results provided will not be accurate. Additionally, if retrieving nutritional information proves to be difficult, implementing a useful tool will be near impossible. Getting a functional GUI will be more difficult than running our software through the terminal, but will make a huge difference in terms of professionalism and functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Course Content:\r\n\r\nSupport on other GUI platforms besides PyGame would be useful to learn about in class. The rest of the project seems manageable with the course content we have already learned, although more understanding of classes and objects will of course help us. We are not sure if it is machine learning, but addressing user feedback (liking or disliking) on recipes and improving suggestions based on that is a stretch goal for us and something we might like to learn more about.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
